The Fitness Booking App is a comprehensive application developed for a school project. It allows users to book coaches, gym sessions, yoga courses, and basketball courts online. Users can also pay for subscriptions, access information about nearby gyms and basketball courts, and manage their accounts. Additionally, the app provides an admin dashboard for managing bookings and user data.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Enables users to create accounts, log in, and securely manage their profiles.
- **Booking System**: Allows users to book coaches, gym sessions, yoga courses, and basketball courts based on availability.
- **Subscription Payments**: Integrates a payment system to process subscriptions for the various fitness activities.
- **Information Retrieval**: Provides information about nearby gyms and basketball courts for user convenience.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Offers an administrative interface to manage bookings, user data, and overall app functionality.

## Implementation Details

- **Java Language**: The application is primarily written in Java, leveraging the power of the Java language.
- **JavaFX**: Utilizes JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI), providing a modern and interactive UI for users.
- **Database Integration**: Implements database integration (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) to store user information, bookings, and gym/court data.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implements secure authentication and authorization processes to ensure data privacy and security.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Utilizes a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) to handle subscription payments.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) with Java and JavaFX support.
3. Build and run the application.
4. Create an account or log in to an existing one.
5. Browse available fitness activities (coaches, gym sessions, yoga courses, basketball courts) and make bookings.
6. Make subscription payments using the integrated payment system.
7. Access the admin dashboard (if applicable) to manage bookings and user data.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed as part of a school assignment to showcase the integration of Java and JavaFX for building a feature-rich fitness booking application. Special thanks to the school and the course instructor for the guidance and support throughout the project.

Feel free to explore the app, interact with the features, and delve into the codebase to understand the implementation details.
